# hello-world
First repository
New to coding. Returning to college in the Fall.
Started learning HTML and CSS online. Joined github to save projects from lessons for reference.
Also will use github for personal projects and experiements with the languages I'm learning.
Github will also make it easier to share my code with my friends, who can help me figure out better ways to write my code.
